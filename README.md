# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is an etch-a-sketch spinoff using divs as the pixels that change color based on mouse input. There are a couple of different modes in here that the user can play around with, including color picker, rainbow, eraser and a sizing slider. All the code written was to implement javascript code to allow the divs to mimic an etch-a-sketch screen. 

There is some additional functionality that I would love to add later on as an improvement. The main one being a shading mode where the color opacity increases in increments of 10% each time the user hovers over a pixel (div). This would allow for some more detailed art!
